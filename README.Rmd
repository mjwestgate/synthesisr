Metascientific analyses - such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses - commonly
involve searches of multiple databases. These databases use a range of different
bibliographic data formats, and have differing degrees of overlap in the
journals and articles that they index. To streamline the process of importing,
assembling, and deduplicating results, `synthesisr` recognizes the file output
of commonly used databases for systematic reviews and merges results into a
standardized format.
