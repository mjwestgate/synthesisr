Metascientific analyses - such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses - commonly
involve searches of multiple databases. These databases use a range of different
bibliographic data formats, and have differing degrees of overlap in the 
journals and articles that they index. To streamline the process of importing, 
assembling, and deduplicating results, `synthesisr` recognizes the file output 
of commonly used databases for systematic reviews and merges results into a 
standardized format.
