Description: Systematic review searches include multiple databases
    that export results in a variety of formats with overlap in 
    coverage between databases. To streamline the process of importing,
    assembling, and deduplicating results, synthesisr recognizes 
    bibliographic files exported from databases commonly used for
    systematic reviews and merges results into a standardized format.
