TI  - Risk-Of-Bias VISualization (robvis): an R package and Shiny web app for
      visualizing risk-of-bias assessments.
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1411 [doi]
AB  - Despite a major increase in the range and number of software offerings now
      available to help researchers produce evidence syntheses, there is currently no
      generic tool for producing figures to display and explore the risk-of-bias
      assessments that routinely take place as part of systematic review. However,
      tools such as the R programming environment and Shiny (an R package for building 
      interactive web apps) have made it straightforward to produce new tools to help
      in producing evidence syntheses. We present a new tool, robvis (Risk-Of-Bias
      VISualization), available as an R package and web app, which facilitates rapid
      production of publication-quality risk-of-bias assessment figures. We present a
      timeline of the tool's development and its key functionality. This article is

TI  - revtools: An R package to support article screening for evidence synthesis.
PG  - 606-614
LID - 10.1002/jrsm.1374 [doi]
AB  - The field of evidence synthesis is growing rapidly, with a corresponding increase
      in the number of software tools and workflows to support the construction of
      systematic reviews, systematic maps, and meta-analyses. Despite much progress,
      however, a number of problems remain, including slow integration of new
      statistical or methodological approaches into user-friendly software, low
      prevalence of open-source software, and poor integration among distinct software 
      tools. These issues hinder the utility and transparency of new methods to the
      research community. Here, I present revtools, an R package to support article
      screening during evidence synthesis projects. It provides tools for the import
      and deduplication of bibliographic data, screening of articles by title or
      abstract, and visualization of article content using topic models. The software
      is entirely open-source and combines command-line scripting for experienced
      programmers with custom-built user interfaces for casual users, with further
      methods to support article screening to be added over time. revtools provides
      free access to novel methods in an open-source environment and represents a
      valuable step in expanding the capacity of R to support evidence synthesis
      projects.
