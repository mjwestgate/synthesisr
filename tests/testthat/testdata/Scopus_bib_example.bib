abstract={Introduction: Wetland soil fauna support material cycling and restoration processes in wetland ecosystems. In our study, we observed variations in wetland soil fauna on the shores of Lake Taihu, China. We examined the relationships between fauna and major environmental factors, and looked at the short-and long-term changes in reed wetlands under restoration and in the natural reed lakeshore. Outcomes: We identified 93 groups of soil fauna in different wetlands and found significant differences in the lakeshore wetlands’ soil fauna assemblages, depending on the length of the restoration period. By analyzing the soil fauna community evenness, dominance, number of taxa, and diversity, we found minimal seasonal variation in the soil fauna community diversity and abundance. The abundance of soil fauna in the sites under restoration decreased with depth below the soil surface. The reed restoration was obvious in the succession of the soil fauna groups in the long-term site. Although the restoration had an overall positive long-term effect on the soil fauna communities, there were no obvious short-term changes in the number of individuals. Conclusion: The study explored various potential measures to restore soil fauna in the Lake Taihu wetland and developed a theoretical basis for restoring the lakeshore wetland ecosystem. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Ecological restoration measures implemented in China have profoundly impacted vegetation NPP. This study aimed to estimate the effects of the land conversion and management measures on the grassland ecosystem in semi-arid regions. Land use data were employed from 2000 to 2015 to compare land conversion and coverage changes in Xilingol grassland. Then, the contributions of land conversion and management policies were quantified by assessing the difference between actual NPP and climate-induced NPP changes. The results indicated that the grassland area had a net loss of 534.42 km2, and the net area of increased vegetation coverage was 74,683.05 km2. Furthermore, the total NPP increased by 8,010.73 Gg C·yr−1 (1 Gg = 109 g), of which the human activities, including grazing management measures (+6,809.40 Gg C·yr−1) and land conversion (45.72 Gg C·yr−1) contributed to 85.58% of the increase in NPP. Transformation from desert and farmland dominated grassland expansion and NPP increase, while urbanization and desertification caused large grassland reduction and NPP loss. The grazing management increased vegetation NPP in most regions except for some regions in the desert steppe and the farming-pastoral zone. Related policies should be further adjusted to strengthen the management of the desert steppe and farming-pastoral regions. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

abstract={Cultural relic is the carrier of human historic culture, which can reflect the cultural and social environment, but cultural relics as a material will be damaged over time. Before the advent of computer technology, the damaged cultural relics would not be repaired due to cost. Computer vision technology has been applied to the restoration of cultural relics, mainly for the virtual restoration of damaged cultural relics images. This paper briefly introduced the Criminisi image restoration algorithm and the structure tensor used to improve the algorithm in the digital cultural relics image restoration. A damaged cultural relics image and a complete image which was damaged by human were repaired respectively using the classical Criminisi image restoration algorithm and the improved structure tensor based repair algorithm on MATLAB software. The results showed that the Criminisi image restoration algorithm could be used to repair the damaged images of ancient fabrics. It was found that the classical image restoration algorithm had some shortcomings, such as inappropriate texture structure, obvious repair marks and addition of redundant information, but the improved algorithm effectively avoided the above shortcomings. The peak signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the complete image which was damaged by human was compared objectively, and it was found that the improved algorithm had better restoration performance. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},
