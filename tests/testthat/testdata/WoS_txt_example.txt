AB Introduction: Wetland soil fauna support material cycling and
   restoration processes in wetland ecosystems. In our study, we observed
   variations in wetland soil fauna on the shores of Lake Taihu, China. We
   examined the relationships between fauna and major environmental
   factors, and looked at the short-and long-term changes in reed wetlands
   under restoration and in the natural reed lakeshore. Outcomes: We
   identified 93 groups of soil fauna in different wetlands and found
   significant differences in the lakeshore wetlands' soil fauna
   assemblages, depending on the length of the restoration period. By
   analyzing the soil fauna community evenness, dominance, number of taxa,
   and diversity, we found minimal seasonal variation in the soil fauna
   community diversity and abundance. The abundance of soil fauna in the
   sites under restoration decreased with depth below the soil surface. The
   reed restoration was obvious in the succession of the soil fauna groups
   in the long-term site. Although the restoration had an overall positive
   long-term effect on the soil fauna communities, there were no obvious
   short-term changes in the number of individuals. Conclusion: The study
   explored various potential measures to restore soil fauna in the Lake
   Taihu wetland and developed a theoretical basis for restoring the
   lakeshore wetland ecosystem.

AB My point of departure is the observation that people ubiquitously turn
   to aesthetic practices in response to the loss of a loved one. I argue
   that profound loss catapults the bereaved person into an alternate
   "world" that differs in marked ways from the world we usually occupy, an
   alternate world lacking even the basic coherence we need to function.
   Aesthetic practices facilitate restoration of coherence to our
   experience, as well as reconnection with the social world and recovery
   from the breakdown that profound loss involves. While the aesthetic
   notion of closure is frequently invoked in connection with the needs of
   the bereaved, I suggest that while containing the emotions experienced
   in connection with loss is vital if they are to be processed,
   unrealistic aspirations toward closure can encourage expectations that
   harm the bereaved. By contrast, I suggest that the aims of aesthetically
   punctuating experience and communicating through aesthetic gestures are
   beneficial for helping the bereaved adjust to their new circumstances.

AB Cultural relic is the carrier of human historic culture, which can
   reflect the cultural and social environment, but cultural relics as a
   material will be damaged over time. Before the advent of computer
   technology, the damaged cultural relics would not be repaired due to
   cost. Computer vision technology has been applied to the restoration of
   cultural relics, mainly for the virtual restoration of damaged cultural
   relics images. This paper briefly introduced the Criminisi image
   restoration algorithm and the structure tensor used to improve the
   algorithm in the digital cultural relics image restoration. A damaged
   cultural relics image and a complete image which was damaged by human
   were repaired respectively using the classical Criminisi image
   restoration algorithm and the improved structure tensor based repair
   algorithm on MATLAB software. The results showed that the Criminisi
   image restoration algorithm could be used to repair the damaged images
   of ancient fabrics. It was found that the classical image restoration
   algorithm had some shortcomings, such as inappropriate texture
   structure, obvious repair marks and addition of redundant information,
   but the improved algorithm effectively avoided the above shortcomings.
   The peak signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the complete image which was
   damaged by human was compared objectively, and it was found that the
   improved algorithm had better restoration performance.

AB Increasing studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are
   associated with the metastasis of gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). Recently,
   miR-324-5p has been reported to be a tumour-suppressive miRNA in many
   types of malignant cancer. However, the biological function and
   molecular mechanism of miR-324-5p in GBC still remain largely unknown.
   Here, we found that miR-324-5p expression was notably down-regulated in
   both GBC tissues and cells compared with that in normal controls.
   Downregulated miR-324-5p expression was negatively associated with the
   status of local invasion and lymph node metastasis and predicted a poor
   prognosis in GBC patients. Further functional assays revealed that
   restoration of miR-324-5p significantly suppressed GBC cell migration,
   invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) invitro and impeded
   the metastasis of GBC cells invivo. Moreover, RNA immunoprecipitation
   (RIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that the transforming
   growth factor beta 2 (TGFB2) was a direct target gene of miR-324-5p in
   GBC cells. Mechanically, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated
   knockdown of TGFB2 partially phenocopied the inhibitory effects of
   miR-324-5p overexpression on GBC cell metastatic phenotypes. In summary,
   our findings demonstrated that miR-324-5p targets TGFB2 expression to
   inhibit GBC cell metastatic behaviors, and implying miR-324-5p as a
   potential biomarker for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in GBC.
