AB  - Agricultural activities in catchments can cause excessive nutrient loads in
      waterways. Catchment nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows may be intercepted and
      assimilated by riparian vegetation. While prior studies suggest that woody
      vegetation is preferable for reducing P loads, the question remains: is woody
      vegetation or grass cover more effective at reducing catchment N and P exports to
      waterways. To address this we investigated the relative importance of vegetation
      type, hydrologic and soil microbial processes on N and P losses from soil to a
      stream. The study involved the analysis of data from two soil microcosm experiments,
      and a field case study. We found P leaching loss from riparian zones depended
      significantly on vegetation type (woody vs. grass cover), with lower P exported from
      wooded riparian zones, irrespective of the scale of rainfall. For N leaching losses,
      the scale of rainfall had an effect. During high rainfall, vegetation type had a
      major effect on N leaching loss, with lower N exported from grassed verses wooded
      riparian zones. However, under low rainfall conditions, soil type and soil C and N
      stores, potential indicators of soil microbial activity, rather than vegetation
      cover, affected N leaching. It is hypothesized that soil microbes were reducing N
      removal under these conditions. We reason that nitrifiers may have played an
      important role in soil N cycling, as increased soil ammonium had a strong positive
      effect on nitrate leaching loads, mediated through soil nitrate stores. Whereas, N
      immobilization, via incorporation into microbial biomass, and denitrification
      processes appeared to be limited by C availability, with increased C associated with
      reduced N leaching. Overall, this study identified that N leaching losses from
      riparian zones appeared to be affected by two different processes, vegetative uptake
      and soil microbial processes, the relative importance of which was driven by
      hydrological conditions.

TI  - Management of Grassland-like Wildflower Strips Sown on Nutrient-rich Arable Soils:
      The Role of Grass Density and Mowing Regime.
PG  - 647-657
LID - 10.1007/s00267-019-01153-y [doi]
AB  - Wildflower strips (WS) are proposed in many European countries as a strategy to
      enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services in arable fields. To create and maintain
      WS on nutrient-rich cultivated soils reveals challenging. Flowered species may be
      outcompeted by grasses due to high phosphorus content in soil. We studied during 5
      years seed mixture (grass density in the seed mix) and mowing regime influenced the
      ability of WS to provide environmental benefits (flower provision for insects and
      landscape purposes, reduction of soil nutrient load) and respond to farmer concerns
      (noxious weed promotion, forage production). Lowered grass density increased flower
      abundance, but not diversity, only in the first 3 years. In the last 2 years mowing
      effects became determinant. Flower cover and richness were the highest under the
      twice-a-year mowing regime. This regime also increased forage quantity and quality.
      Flower colour diversity was conversely the highest where mowing occurred every two
      years. Potassium in the soil decreased under the twice-a-year mowing regime. Other
      nutrients were not affected. No management option kept noxious weed to an acceptable
      level after 5 years. This supports the need to test the efficacy of specific
      management practices such as selective clipping or spraying. Mowing WS twice a year
      was retained as the most favourable treatment to maintain species-rich strips with
      an abundant flower provision. It however implies to mow in late June, i.e. at the
      peak of insect abundance. It is therefore suggested to keep an unmown refuge zone
      when applying this management regime.

TI  - Mulch and groundcover effects on soil temperature and moisture, surface reflectance,
      grapevine water potential, and vineyard weed management.

AB  - The objectives of this research were to identify alternatives to glyphosate for
      intra-row (under-trellis) vineyard floor management and to evaluate the potential
      for intra-row and inter-row (alleyway) groundcovers to reduce vegetative vigor
      of 'Marquette' grapevines (Vitis spp.) in a southeast Nebraska vineyard. The
      experiment was a randomized factorial design with five intra-row treatments (crushed
      glass mulch [CG], distillers' grain mulch [DG], creeping red fescue [CRF],
      non-sprayed control [NSC], and glyphosate [GLY]) and three inter-row treatments
      (creeping red fescue [CRF], Kentucky bluegrass [KB], and resident vegetation [RV]).
      Treatments were established in 2010-2011 and measurements were conducted during 2012
      and 2013 on 5- and 6-year-old vines. Soil temperatures were mostly higher under
      mulches and lower under intra-row groundcovers, compared to GLY. Weed cover in CG,
      DG, and CRF treatments was the same or less than GLY. At most sampling dates,
      inter-row soil moisture was lowest under KB. Intra-row soil moisture was highest
      under DG mulch and lowest under CRF and NSC; CG had the same or lower soil moisture
      than GLY. Surprisingly, we did not detect differences in mid-day photosynthetically
      active radiation (PAR) reflectance, despite visual differences among the intra-row
      treatments. Mid-day vine water potential did not differ among treatments. We
      concluded it is not necessary to maintain a bare soil strip under established vines
      in this region, where soil fertility and moisture are non-limiting.
